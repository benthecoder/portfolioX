title: About Me
---

I am a contributing writer to Towards Data Science, Better Programming, and Startup publication on Medium. My articles have over 950k views and I have over 2k followers. 

I'm currently pursuing a Statistics Bachelor's degree in the American Degree Transfer Program at INTI Subang and will be transferring to Iowa State University in Fall 2021. 

During the MCO, I have been utilizing the resources online to learn about R and Statistics, two very important tools in Data Science, and I've been developing my Python skills in order to be proficient in learning PyTorch for Deep Learning. 

I'm currently looking for an internship before I transfer to the United States to gain experience.
